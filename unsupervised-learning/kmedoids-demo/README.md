# K-Medoids Clustering Demo

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of the **K-Medoids clustering algorithm** on a real-world dataset.  
K-Medoids is an unsupervised learning algorithm used to partition data into distinct clusters using actual data points as cluster centers (medoids), making it more robust to outliers compared to K-Means.

## Dataset
The dataset used contains customer behavior information with numerical features suitable for clustering.  


## Steps in Analysis
1. Load and explore the dataset.
2. Preprocess data (handle missing values, normalize features, etc.).
3. Determine the optimal number of clusters (e.g., using the Elbow method).
4. Apply K-Medoids clustering.
5. Visualize and interpret the clusters.
