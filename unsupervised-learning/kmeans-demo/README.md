# K-means demo: Customer Purchase Behaviour

## Goal
Segment customers based on their annual income and spending score using **K-means clustering**.
We will go step-by-step:
- Load data from CSV
- Preprocess and clean
- Decide the optimal number of clusters (using Elbow Method and Silhouette Score)
- Fit K-means model
- Visualize and interpret clusters
- Save final clustered data for later use
